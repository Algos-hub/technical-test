# Technical Test

## Guidelines

- clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at the end of each level
- once you are done, email us

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the **simplest thing** that could work for the level you're currently solving.

Disclaimer: the levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is:
- clean
- extensible


## Things to know

- all prices are stored as integers (in cents)
